    <td>In today's lesson rather than looking at the excel we decided to improve our websites by adding features for example putting our work into our blog post and then we made sure that they were all functioning and working to how they should be. And we used the iframeto then embed our work into the blog using - <iframe src=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0CWf32Rtnhpu-w9s7XpSKie9ARK1DUtasFpuPQFbYYeWduGSVItcVhLV-PiSTEKYi9ieeM-ii8ji6/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false></iframe>. With speech marks around the link that you want to embed into the blog. </td>
