    <td>To sum up this year it has been a year with many struggles however with those struggles with some help from the teacher and with some help from friends I have been able to get round these problems. The best bit of this year for me was the Robotic Arm as I found it really amazing how some simple code can do so much and also in the build up to that doing the LED's I found them really enjoyable as well. Then moving onto the python I learnt that some of the basic problems were simply because of logic.

Overall Year I.T has been a lot of fun and some of the things that we did this year that I really wasnâ€™t confident with at the start of the year I am now more comfortable with. </td>
