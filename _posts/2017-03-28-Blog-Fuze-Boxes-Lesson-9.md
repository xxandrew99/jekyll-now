    <td>We learnt well as we are more familiar with how the robotic arm as we knew how it worked basically and that helped with the overall progress of the lesson. Also I thought that my partner helped a lot as he understood it as we had done a lot of looking into how we were to do it last lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning really was the structure of the handbook as it was quite complicated and I didn't find it that clear in some cases</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think that we will be quicker when getting everything set up as today we were a bit slow to start but we did make quick progress throughout the rest of the lesson.</td>
