  <tr>
    <td>I think that we learnt well as we understood more about the wiring of the fuze and also I think what also helped was the fact that we understood the wiring better than we did before so that also helped a lot.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on trying to remember to save the work as in some cases in the lesson I rushed into trying to save the work but instead I couldn't get it back again so I had to write it out again with my partner.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I donâ€™t think I would change anything for next time as we made good progress throughout the lesson as the videos show.</td>
