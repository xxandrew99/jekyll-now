    <td>In today's lesson we started by making sure that everyone had managed to get to the same point from last week and then we looked at how we can make it easier if there is a 20% reduction or buy one get one free etc... Then we looked into the 'ifâ€™ function and the greater than function to enable the reductions of the overall price to be able to work and make it easier for workers at my Virtual Shop. The if function is useful if you want to prevent errors from occuring in your spreadsheet and if these were used in real lif situations this could cause delay's in shops. All of this is to make paying for things quicker so that shoppers can go from shop to shop easily.
