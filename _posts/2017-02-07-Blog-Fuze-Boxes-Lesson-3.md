    <td>Me and my partner Shaveen, we took it in turns to read the instructions and to actually write the the code I think was effective as we made good progress throughout the lesson.</td>

    <td>I think the only problem that occurred from the lessons today was that we had problems as in the monitor closed unexpectedly and caused us to not be able to save our work but we managed to get around this problem by still being able to complete 2 of the codes.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

    <td>Make sure that we are able to figure out the problems quicker e.g: make sure we manage to get the monitor restarted quicker.</td>
