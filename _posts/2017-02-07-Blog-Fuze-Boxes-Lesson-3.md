    <td>I think the only problem that occurred from the lessons today was that we had problems as in the monitor closed unexpectedly and caused us to not be able to save our work but we managed to get around this problem by still being able to complete 2 of the codes.</td>

    <td>Make sure that we are able to figure out the problems quicker e.g: make sure we manage to get the monitor restarted quicker.</td>
