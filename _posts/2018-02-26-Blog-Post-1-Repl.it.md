    <td>In today's lesson we learnt about the basic functions of repl.it we learnt how using code we can make the computer do simple things for example making shapes and patterns like telling the computer how to make a triangle and then once we had these we learnt how we could make more than just a triangle and then go on to make different shapes for example squares and then adding on sides to make maybe a 30 sided shape all through code. Using python to enable this.</td>
