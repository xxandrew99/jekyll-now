    <td>This week I was on a school trip however in the catchup I learnt how to write letters using different angles and distances to form a letter using turtle python, to do this I used commands such as turtle.left(75) and turtle.forward(100) we used this to help form the letter A and then I used this to form another letter to form my initials.</td>
