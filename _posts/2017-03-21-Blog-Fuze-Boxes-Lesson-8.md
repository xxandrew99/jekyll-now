(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>

    <th>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the best ways of me learning with the robot arm was to use my own knowledge and also to try and use the books help but also to try and use my own ideas and the fact that i used my own ideas I think that is what helped it move easier.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the things that limited my learning, was the fact that as it was the first lesson on actually using the robot arm I found it quite hard to get used to but hopefully next lesson I will be more familiar with all of the code that is required for the next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think that we will know better what we are doing and then next time hopefully we would be able to understand more easily about what to do next time.</td>
