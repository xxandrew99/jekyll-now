    <td>I learnt really well by using trial and improvement and I think that was a massive benefit as in most of the cases that I found tricky I managed solve the problems by just going through the instructions again without to much difficulty.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I think the fact that I tried to rush on and go straight to the instructions rather than reading what I was actually doing, that might help me understand better for next time.</td>
