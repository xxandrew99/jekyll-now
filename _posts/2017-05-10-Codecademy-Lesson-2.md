  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by persevering rather than giving in as soon as there was a bit that I didn't understand and that really helped me understand what to do.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the only thing that limited my learning was probably myself because sometimes it is quite tempting just to look across the classroom and see what somebody else has done but I managed to prevent myself from doing that.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think that I will improve my learning by doing more research at home how I can improve what I do in python.</td>
