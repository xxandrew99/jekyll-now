    <td>In today's lesson we were introduced to excel and how using an excel document you can achieve much more than just drawing out a table and how formulae can be put into the system to make calculations much easier, In this lesson we looked at some of the best ways of handling data by creating our own virtual pet shop and in this we added code to make the excel document run quickly and efficiently with the minimum errors it was interesting because we were told that this is very useful and as we progress through jobs excel documents are very important to handling large quantities of data efficiently rather than using it all by hand which would take much longer

We learnt about some of the basic functions for example 'iferror' and ‘vlookup’ to enable us to progress through the lesson.</td>
