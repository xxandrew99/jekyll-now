    <td>This week I was ill but for the catchup I looked through what we had done in the lesson and how come can be used to answer questions and make a questionnaire. In particular in this lesson we looked at the print function to print strings for the user to be able to read and also use the elif function and the if function to respond to the answer that the user responds with, I then repeated this to make a longer series of questions.</td>
