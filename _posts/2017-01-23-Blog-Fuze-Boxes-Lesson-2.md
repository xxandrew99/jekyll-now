  <tr>
    <td>I learnt very well when working as a team and that really helped the progress of my learning because when I work with Shaveen, we feel as though we work well and we split the time equally. It is so much easier having a good partner to work with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the only thing that limited my learning today was Shaveen's Memory Stick as for some reason, it crashed the whole fuze box so he didnâ€™t manage to get them saved but we thought of a way round this problem by me sending it to him afterwards via email.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the only thing that I would change is by asking Shaveen to get a new Memory Stick and also maybe try and solve problems such as this in the future a bit quicker rather than having to spend a lot of time trying to repeat things without changing something. Instead I will try and change something each time to make it better.</td>
