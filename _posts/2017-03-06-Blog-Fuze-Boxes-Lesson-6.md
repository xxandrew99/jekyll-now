    <td>This lesson we didn't have anything that limited our learning and we managed to get what we wanted to be done. We read out the code and we solved problems well.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will be more inquisitive into how the LED’s work and even try to get more in than I did this week. If we work as well as we did this week then I think we will definitely be able to make even more progress with the LED’s</td>
