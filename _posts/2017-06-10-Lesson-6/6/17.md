    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>We started with the question, How do you make a cup of tea?</td>

    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>To be able to not presume things in code but however giving exact commands.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td> Yes as we manage to rather than presume that you boil the kettle with the water inside, we could actually do it without presuming.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We learnt that rather than just presuming what is going on and not actually stating whats going on it is much harder with coding, and we learnt that computers only do what we ask them to do and we have got to be careful as computers only work in 1's and 0â€™s. (Binary)</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I am a person that would be more vague and I need to work on being more accurate with what I say.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be less vague when I am working on coding because then I make sometimes small mistakes that are so small that I have to get a hint.</td>
